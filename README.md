# Learning Python here at Udox

## What to do

Clone this repo (git clone). Then make a branch for *your* code (git checkout -b YOUR_NAME).
Now work away and commit and then push back your code (git push -u origin YOUR_NAME).

Take a look at the google.py file first. You'll see the simple function that will read in the
udox html into a variable, then turn it into "soup". Amend the function as requested then
try running it.

## Resources

To share python code try using pythonanywhere.com to share a console. Remember to play with
code using iPython - you can interactivly see what is going on and inspect variables as you
go.
